# Finite-Differences-for-the-Wave-Equation
Finite differences is a numerical method approximating solutions to partial differential equations by dividing the domain into a grid, computing the difference between adjacent points to approximate derivatives. It's often used in physics and engineering for solving wave equations in acoustic and electromagnetic fields.
